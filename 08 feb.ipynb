    "Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object or system. It involves creating a simplified model or representation of the object that focuses on its essential characteristics and hides its implementation details. Abstraction allows us to work with complex systems without being concerned about the underlying complexity, and it enables us to create models or representations that are easier to understand and work with.\n",

It enables data hiding, which means that the internal details of the object are not visible to the outside world, and can only be accessed through well-defined interfaces provided by the class. Encapsulation helps to ensure that the object's state remains consistent and that its behavior is well-defined."
