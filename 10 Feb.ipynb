    "'w' (Write mode): This mode opens the file for writing, and if the file already exists, its contents are truncated. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",

If you don't close the file, these resources may remain allocated even after your program exits, which can lead to resource leaks and other problems.\n",
    "Ensure data is written to disk: When you write to a file, the data is not immediately written to disk. Instead, it is written to a buffer in memory, and the operating system decides when to flush the buffer to disk. If you don't close the file, the buffer may not be flushed to disk, and some of your data may be lost.\n",
